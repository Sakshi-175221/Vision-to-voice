Key Features:

Object Detection: Leveraging YOLOv8 for real-time identification of 80 common object classes using the COCO dataset.
Audio Guidance: Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality (gTTS & pyttsx3) to transform visual information into audible cues.
Distance Approximation: Enabling spatial awareness by calculating relative distances and offering real-time obstacle guidance.
Directional Assistance: Smart navigation commands suggesting left/right movements based on obstacle positioning.

Why It Matters:
Our solution addresses challenges in dynamic environments, offering real-time feedback to foster independence and confidence. By combining computer vision with assistive technology, we strive to create a safer, more inclusive world.
